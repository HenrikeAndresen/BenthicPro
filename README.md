# BenthicPro
## Estimates secondary productivity of macrozoobenthic populations

## Description

This package estimates productivity and production of aquatic macrobenthic invertebrate populations. Its function BenthicPB is the translation to R of the Excel spreadsheet "ProductivityANN01" from the ["Virtual Handbook on Population Dynamics"](http://www.thomas-brey.de/science/virtualhandbook/navlog/index.html). It estimates population production-to-biomass ratio from biomass and other specific abiotic and biotic information by means of an empirical model. This model has been developed by Thomas Brey and constitutes a composite Artificial Neural Network based on 1252 data sets of population production referring to 635 species and 519 references.
